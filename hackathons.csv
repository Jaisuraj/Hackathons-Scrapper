AWS Disaster Response Hackathon,14056,"Dec 01, 2021","Feb 07, 2022",,open,https://awsdisasterresponse.devpost.com/,"Both the frequency and severity of natural disasters are increasing. This year alone, we have seen significant wildfires across the Western United States and in countries like Greece and Turkey; major floods across Europe; a 7.2 earthquake in Haiti, and Hurricane Ida’s impact to the coast of Louisiana. In response, governments, businesses, nonprofits, and international organizations are placing more emphasis on disaster preparedness and response than ever before. Many of these same entities are accelerating their efforts to make their data publicly available for others to use. Repositories such as the Registry of Open Data on AWS and Humanitarian Data Exchange contain treasure troves of data that is ripe for use by developers, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners.
At AWS, we believe that technology has the power to solve the world’s most pressing issues. As we build and improve new services such as Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab, we take pride in supporting the new and innovative ways our customers are using these technologies to deliver social impact. Through this hackathon, we hope to stimulate ways to apply machine learning to solve pressing challenges in natural disaster preparedness and response.
The scope of this hackathon is broad, but we have provided some parameters to guide participants’ work:


The solution must solve a challenge that is aligned with at least one of the phases of the disaster life cycle (mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery).


The solution must focus on a challenge that is present in one or more types of natural disaster (e.g. hurricanes/cyclones; wildfires; floods; earthquakes; drought; etc.).


The solution must use machine learning to solve the challenge. This includes the submission of a machine learning model that helps people predict, identify, categorize, prioritize etc. 


Example challenges include:


How might we accurately and efficiently determine the extent of damage to individual homes in a given disaster-impacted area?

How might we detect stress signals from radio communications?

How might we predict where first-responder assets are most likely to be needed in a disaster (a) before it happens, or (b) immediately after it happens?


How might we predict the spread of wildfires?

Check out the inspiration page for more ideas.

The project should also focus on accessibility and an ease of use for disaster response organizations with limited technology and machine learning knowledge.",N/A,Devpost,,

Could we be making more progress, faster? Are there problems to solve, or capabilities to gain that are ""unlocks"" for the next steps of civilization?

Imagine writing down 99 problems for your domain. Alongside a million other people! Now make it easy to gather the problems into maps. It’s a network of problems!

Or let’s start from the top. How do we chart - and fund - humanity’s challenges, from cracking climate to exploring the cosmos? 

The point is not to agree; some solutions will seem like problems to others. The point is to coordinate with those solving similar problems, to find and fund new opportunities.
 
A good way to figure out if such maps are useful is by prototyping them. For that, we need an app that allows you to contribute, fork, and iterate. 
 
The main $30k prize is for creating such an app.
 
Or, you can constructively tell us why we’re wrong and win a $1k bounty.
 
The Hackathon
 
Create a fun app to open source collaboration on maps of problems (Miro-style) through crowdsourcing (Wikipedia-style) and crowdfunding (Kickstarter-style).
 
Individuals and communities will use it to coordinate on their local problems, such as Matters.Global's Problem Maps, or Foresight Institute's Longevity Tech Tree. 
 
Others will use the app to incentivize desirable trajectories through the problem spaces, as described in Trent McConaghy’s Starships & Tokens, or Balaji Srinivasan's Tech Tree.",N/A,Devpost,,

We believe that Sonr is the only solution to onboard 95% of the world without crypto onto the Decentralized Web. Sonr does this with its built in Networking Protocol that integrates Identity, Discovery, and Delivery, abstracting away all the mess away from both Users and Developers.
Why participate? 
Join our first annual hackathon at #MiamiHackWeek2022 at the famous Versace House in Miami. We will be accepting 15 hackers to create the next generation of App's while showcasing our brand new SDK.
Building a DApp on Sonr requires zero background. Simply pull the SDK from your favorite package manager and simply design frontend code and business logic. We believe the only way that crypto can become mainstream is through Integrated, Immersive, and Real-Time Apps.
What is Sonr? 
In today’s world we can all be uniquely identified by physical forms of identification, like driver’s licenses. This identification can be used to secure our personal data, and gate the interactions that we have with each other. 
Imagine a world tomorrow where we can be uniquely identified digitally, with a digital driver’s license that secures our personal data and gates our peer to peer interactions. With this license you can sign into applications, grant access to your personal data, and communicate with other license holders anywhere directly and in real-time. Sonr is the data delivery protocol for tomorrow’s world.
Our protocol offers a digital license-like experience combining Identification, Discovery, Delivery, and Transmission. Users of the protocol can share any type of data such as money, files, messages, contracts, and other digital assets as simply as Airdrop without the need for centralized storage mechanisms like Cloud storage. The Sonr protocol allows decentralized application developers to build for the world of tomorrow, enabling them to create secure and seamless peer-to-peer web application experiences.

From entertainment to healthcare, to communication, and increasingly so in remote working environments, we turn to sound technology to connect us. But imagine trying to conduct a Zoom call, access TeleHealth services, or tap into a Clubhouse conversation without the ability to hear. 
The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, nearly 2.5 billion people will have some degree of hearing loss. The rapidly growing hard-of-hearing community encounters accessibility issues today – issues that Tech can address.
 
About Girls in Tech
Girls in Tech empowers women to tackle global issues using tech skills. We’re passionate about building equal and inclusive experiences that bring people together. We invite you to join us in developing much-needed tech solutions for the hard-of-hearing community. Whether you’re a web developer, a designer, a product developer, an engineer, a strategist, or anyone with ideas – we need your input.
 
PRODUCT CHALLENGE IDEAS
Here are some ideas for solutions you could help develop:


Communication: Technology that transcribes or adds subtitles to virtual collaboration tools like Zoom or phone calls.




Healthcare: Solutions to enable hard-of-hearing people to access in-person or TeleHealth services without sign language translation.


Wellbeing and fitness: Apps linking hearing aid devices to health technology like heart rate monitoring, step counting, workouts, or meditation practices.


Emergency access: Ways to connect with emergency services in a nonverbal way.


Culture and entertainment: Ways to make audio-based apps (Spotify, Clubhouse, Netflix) accessible to the hard-of-hearing.

So —  we’re inviting software developers to rethink and redefine how all the relevant data is collected and processed. Hackers, creators, designers, and coders will collaborate and compete using AI, XR, blockchain, data analytics, and other state-of-the-art technologies — with guidance from our group of industry mentors — to build a prototype for a simpler,  more effective platform around cue sheets and artist payments. 
Our goal is to free up a music creator's time to make music — and not spend hours on administrative work in order to get paid.  After the marathon 24-hour session, a panel of industry judges will choose the winning teams, who will be awarded cash and sponsor prizes. The Cue Sheet Palooza Hackathon is set for Saturday and Sunday, April 9-10, 2022 in-person in Toronto, Canada. Exact location to be announced.

 Hosted by the Brandeis MakerLab partnered with the Brandeis International Business School, this year's 'Deis Hacks is a 48-hour design competition targeted at real world solutions. 
 
 
   
 
 
 This social design challenge focused on disequity sources our hack-challenges from the 15 not for profits and social enterprise organizations local to Waltham. Instead of having a single hackathon challenge, this event's theme will fuse design thinking, digital fabrication & social impact to work on real world solutions for non-profit companies. Each hackathon team will chose a design challenge from Waltham's diverse non-profit community they find compelling to focus on. 
 
 
   
 
 
 Welcome to #deisHacks 
 
 
   
   
 
 
Why DeisHacks?
 
 
   
 
 
 Our hacks are identied by 15 local non-prot organizations in which Brandeis students serve as non-voting Board Fellows. 
 
 
 A hackathon is typically a technology-focused event, however we’ve looked beyond computer science enthusiasts, integrating students of all majors, to help serve local non-prot needs. 
 
 
   
   
 
 
Community Impact
 
 
   
 
 
 Last year’s winning hack was a multi-language text app to bridge the Waltham Boy’s and Girl’s club’s challenge of low participation rates amongst non-english speakers. Because Brandeis Board fellows had prior knowledge of the club’s operations, the assigned hackathon team was able to identify the club’s diculty as language-barrier driven.",N/A,Devpost,,

In recent years, the use of technology has increased in many areas including the automobile industry. The use of technology in the automobile industry has brought many benefits, including simplification and convenience in the purchasing, after-sales processes, utilization of vehicles.
For example, the traditional car-purchase experiences are basically visiting a showroom, seeing a car with your own eyes, and taking it for a test drive, then you purchase it if you like it. But it has been enhanced by online purchasing experiences such as High-speed Internet and XR technology recently. 
In terms of the use of automobiles, there is a wide range of ways in which the automobile can be used as a personal space. Also, the automobile itself can be used as a sensor, not only for smart city applications but also can be a monitor to check the health of the car for preventing and predicting any future breakdowns.
When 5G, which is expected to be widespread in the near future, becomes available for automobiles, they will be used for many more purposes than they are now. Not only allowing people to enjoy driving but also to use their cars to enjoy other things by utilizing its space. It can also make a better buying experience possible when customers are thinking purchase.
With the crossover of technology and automobiles, we believe that we can see a new automobile industry through this hackathon, we would like to find innovative ideas and solutions on the theme of ""New Digital Transformation through Automobiles in India"".

The Blue Sky Challenge 
Let’s keep the sky blue and the earth green!! 

Monitoring air quality in various cities across the globe is becoming an utmost necessity as air pollution can lead to several respiratory/cardiovascular diseases. As per reports from WHO, more than 7 million mortalities have been recorded worldwide due to diseases related to air pollution. Increasing urbanisation and industrialisation have a negative impact on air quality which is already alarming in many cities across the world. In practice, the installation of ground stations for local air quality measurement would not be a feasible solution. A mobile application in this regard would enable us to make an informed decision.
In this direction, this hackathon aims to find solutions in two different approaches which are categorized in two sub-themes, (a) to analyse satellite imagery data to estimate the pollutants in a given area, and (b) to discover new innovative solutions for developing smart air quality monitoring systems by integrating sensor technology with machine learning algorithms. The challenges with satellite images include the availability of only temporal snapshots of data instead of continuous data, a huge data size of the imagery data makes them not suitable to be downloaded through mobile networks to consumer devices, and processing of such data with limited computational capacity in the mobile devices. Similarly, the sensor data in many cases need to be screened to estimate failures, anomalies, and errors associated with the same. This hackathon targets finding solutions in a hybrid approach. Further, this event will also provide a platform for technology and innovation enthusiasts from different parts of the world to demonstrate and showcase their skills for the betterment of society. 
The participants are expected to find and submit solutions in the proposed sub-themes. The submissions will be then evaluated by experts. 

Each registering team needs to submit max 1000 words on their approach to solving the sub-theme problems. Final decision on winners and other matters will be taken by the panel of judges.
